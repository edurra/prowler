  "Risk": "Azure SQL servers provide a firewall that, by default, blocks all Internet connections. When the rule (0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255) is used, the server can be accessed by any source from the Internet, incrementing significantly the attack surface of the SQL Server. It is recommended to use more granular firewall rules.",
